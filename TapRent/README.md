This plugin basically let's you rent a home, you tap a sign, and the plugin sets the text to whatever you put in the configuration file. it sets home wherever you tap a sign and you do /home to teleport to it. also it takes money that is set in the configuration file, it only supports EconomyAPI for the moment. to reset the renting sign you break it and the plugin will set it the text to whatever you have in the configuration file.
